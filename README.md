The main goal of this project - recognize set of German traffic signs with help of convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on data set, prepared in advance. Detail description of work done is [here](./writeup.md).

**Project content**
*	[Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) – Jupyter IPython notebook with code and results of it running.
*	[Traffic_Sign_Classifier_output.html](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier_output.html) – the same Jupyter IPython notebook exported in HTML format
*	[writeup.md](./writeup.md) – project description in details
*	[signs_data](./signs_data) – folder with for 3 data sets - training, validation and test "pickled" by Python. This folder is empty because GitHub file size limitation. Download it from here(https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip) and unpack in this folder.
*	[signs_new](./signs_new) - folder with set of new German traffic sign examples, found in Internet. Each image has PNG format and square size >= 32x32
